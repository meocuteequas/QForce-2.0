description: Rules for determining if a component should be private or shared, and where to place them based on their use-case.
---

- Private Components: For components used only within specific pages, you can create a _components folder within the relevant /app subdirectory.
- Shared Components: The /app/components folder should contain reusable components used across multiple pages or features.
- Dialog: Newly created dialogs should be placed in the folder `/components/dialogs` to maintain reuseability.
